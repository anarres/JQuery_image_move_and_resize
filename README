This simple JQuery script allowing the user to change the position and aspect ratio of an image. This is useful in the situation where you want to allow a user to upload and image, and then crop and resize it. (This script doesn't do the cropping, but it allows you to get the coordinates to crop to).

To get this to work you will need to change the <script> path to point to a copy of JQuery on your computer, and you will have to change the <img> tag to point to an image.

This isn't meant to be a finished application, but rather a simple example that can be adapted to your needs.

Enjoy!
